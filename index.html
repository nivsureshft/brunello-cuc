            Men’s tailoring is an art form that has its roots in Italy, in great part. Today,

          In the quote above you find the beauty and uniqueness of men’s tailoring, a  craft that is progressively able
          to remain a symbol true to itself despite the  everchanging lifestyles. Today, it needs to guide thet 21st
          century man through the new paradigms of contemporary elegance. One underlining truth remains constant in
          time: the one garment a man should own is a suit.
          <p>
            In Solomeo – the Italian fashion house’s headquarter – the mission is to create the inimitable ageless look
            for every man’s needs. They look at traditions and heritage to interpret modern principles of exclusivity
            and
            sophistication. For the brand, the suit is the ultimate symbol of effortless elegance and personal style.

          <span> ‘This look, the jeans and tailoring, is for anyone. If I cover my face, if you just look at my clothes, you
          would have no idea what age I was - I could be 20, I could be 60’ </span> — Brunello Cucinelli.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Mr Cucinelli says, his brand’s looks are ageless and their style is adaptable to men of all generations.
          Not
          two suits are the same though, as each man’s choice of details give it a unique personality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their constant search for excellence results in suits made with natural fabrics, traditional patterns and
          innovative details. Fabrics like velvet, flannel and pinstripes celebrate the rich history of sartorial
          tradition. Also, fluid and lightweight fabrics in solid shades of colour are enhanced by warm and natural
          tones.
          The character and aesthetics of a suit comes from the combination of all these elements, always aiming at
          reflecting its future owner’s personality.

            <p>Even the designer himself has his own version of the suit, reinterpreted with an Italian ‘gusto’– “a very
              fitted jacket, which I would call one-and-a-half breasted,in lightweight cashmere and lightly structured
              with typically Italian details like a four-button cuff, two undone. The back is also very fitted – I
              believe a man’s jacket should show the shape of his chest andhis bottom”. </p>
            <p>
              The tailoring of a suit needs to accentuate the male body to give life to a distinctive and unique
              personal fit, believes Cucinelli. At Sartoria Solomeo, in fact, they accompany their customers every step
              of the way starting from the choice of models and fits to the ample selection of exquisite Italian fabrics
              and they guide them in choosing the perfect details - essential to complement the style of a suit.

            <p>The luxury prêt-à-porter fashion house is widely recognised as one of the quintessential cashmere
              manufacturers in the world today. Although not all may know there is much more to the brand. Brunello has
              managed to build a sustainable and humanistic company, where the real value comes from respecting the
              environment.</p>
            <p>
              Sustainability, ethical production and maintaining local craftsmanship are just some of the pioneering
              ways that Cucinelli is investing in the local community through philanthropy.
            </p>
            <p>
              In every aspect of Brunello’s vision there is always a clear combination of art, tradition and humanity.
              His sense of beauty exudes from his headquarters set up in Solomeo’s medieval castle, through to its
              ethical production and sense of community at the heart of his brand’s values. The marriage of old and
              modern is visibly reflected in their creations too, showcasing Italian craftsmanship and savoir faire
              wrapped in a modern design.
