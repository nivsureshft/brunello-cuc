                tailoring, a craft that is still true to itself despite the everchanging lifestyles. Today it needs to
                guide 21st century men across the new paradigms of contemporary elegance. One underlying truth stays the
                same over time: the one garment a man should own is a suit.

              </p>
              <p>
                In Solomeo – headquarters of the Italian fashion house – the mission is to create a distinctive ageless
                look for every man’s needs. Traditions and heritage are taken into account to interpret the modern
                principles of exclusivity and sophistication. For the brand, the suit is the ultimate symbol of
                effortless elegance and personal style.

              <p>
                As Mr Cucinelli says, his brand’s looks are ageless and their style is suitable for any man, regardless
                of
                age. Two suits are never the same though, since the details one chooses confer a a unique personality to
                the overall look.
              </p>
              <p>
                The brand's constant search for excellence translates into suits made with natural fabrics, traditional
                patterns and innovative details. Fabrics like velvet, flannel and pinstripes celebrate the rich history
                of
                sartorial tradition. Also, flowing and lightweight fabrics in solid colours are enhanced by warm and
                natural tones. The character and aesthetics of a suit is the result of the combination of all these
                elements, whose purpose is to reflect the future owner’s personality.

              <p>Even the designer himself has his own version of the suit, reinterpreted with an Italian ‘gusto’– “a

                details like a four-button cuff, two of which undone. The back is also very fitted – I believe a man’s
                jacket should show the shape of his chest and bottom”.

                A tailored suit must enhance the male body for a distinctive and unique personal fit, believes
                Cucinelli. At Sartoria Solomeo they indeed flank their customers all the way through, from the selection
                of fabrics and fit down to the smallest detail - essential to complement the style of a suit.

                <p>The luxury prêt-à-porter fashion house is widely recognised as one of the quintessential cashmere
                  manufacturers in the world today. However, there is much more to the brand than clothes. Brunello has
                  managed to build a sustainable and humanistic company, where the real value comes from respecting the
                  environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sustainability, ethical production and local craftsmanship are just some of the pioneering ways in
                  which Cucinelli is investing in the local community through philanthropy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Brunello’s vision always includes a combination of art, tradition and humanity. His sense of beauty
                  can be clearly perceived at his headquarters in Solomeo’s medieval castle, as well as in the ethical
                  production and sense of community that lie at the heart of his brand’s values. The combination of
                  tradition and modernity is visible in the brand's creations too, showcasing Italian craftsmanship and
                  savoir faire wrapped in a modern design.
